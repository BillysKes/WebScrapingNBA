## Summary
The python scripts were created for experimentation purposes using the beautifulsoup library to extract data from a website. More specifically, in the first script for example, we collect statistics information about the top 50 NBA players in the current league and to make this possible we have to view the page source code in order to discover which html tag stores the information we are interested in and then we need to find the attribute value so we can retrieve the data using the beautiful soup library. We also follow the same process in the second script in which we collect statistics information about all the NBA teams, in the current season, such as, wins, losses, win rates,points per game and more. After the retrieval of data, we export them as csv files. A more advanced web scrapper can be created, which can include statistic information of the teams performance history in the previous years, with the motivation to build predictive models.
